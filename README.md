# Note:
This is an old code base used for a april fools joke in 2017. None of the URLs, passwords or uniquie IDs here are in use, hence them being published publicly. The sqlite database should NOT be used on a live teampseak instance, due to the server specific private information contained within it being accessible by anyone. This information would allow an attacker to immitate and decrypt any traffic from or to a teamspeak server using this database. Thsi code is presented without any warranty or support, and is given here in an as-is state. Consider it useful for REFERENCE ONLY.



# Warning!!!!
## This code is held together with chewing gum and bits of string we found under the desk. It was cobbled together in around 20 man hours and is NOT good production code!

# Important Shit:

## ServerQuery
- address: `magic.adam-ant.co.uk:10011`
- username: `serveradmin`
- password: `DE0xWKTx`
